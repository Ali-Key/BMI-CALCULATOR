# BMI Calculator App

BMI Calculator is my second project using Flutter for mobile app development. This project has provided me with valuable learning opportunities. Some of the key lessons I've learned include:

- Understanding the difference between stateless and stateful widgets.
- Implementing Material Design principles in Flutter for a visually appealing user interface.
- Managing exports and imports of files to organize the project structure effectively.
- Extracting widgets to create reusable components and improve code organization.
- Navigating between different pages in the app using Flutter's navigation system.
- Utilizing FontAwesome icons in Flutter to enhance the app's visual elements.

- **Calculate BMI**: Enter your height and weight to calculate your BMI.
- **Weight Categories**: The app classifies your BMI into underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese categories.
